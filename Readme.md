This program is to demonstrate the Raspberry Pi Cytron maker Pi RP2040.

The program is to represent 6 zebra crossing on your model railway layout. It is a waste of the board but I am using for learning how to program in MicroPython.
There are many ways this program could have been written. However I am keeping it simple so new comers to MicroPython can learn how you can access the GP pins
on the Pi Pico. The code will work on a standard Pi Pico but will need to add Leds and resistors as required.

There is a video on Youtube explaining the code.

More advanced prorams will be added to the youtube channel.
